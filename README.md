# Horse Racing Predictor: A Fun Project

## Description

This is a small, fun project developed to predict horse racing outcomes based on some hypothetical parameters. Using data scraped from the South China Morning Post for the first race on 11.10.23, the app computes scores for different horses using a set of arbitrarily selected factors.

## Data Import
The data for this project was manually extracted from the South China Morning Post's Race Card for the specified race date. While this manual approach was suitable for a fun project, for a more extensive dataset, web scraping tools or an API would be recommended.

## Tools & Packages Used
- Streamlit: Used to transform the project into an interactive web application.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Python: The core programming language of the project.
- And various other Python packages to assist in data preprocessing and calculation.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed: pip install streamlit pandas
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run: `streamlit run app.py`

Enjoy the app and remember it's all in good fun! üêé
